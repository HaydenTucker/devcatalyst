<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings can be used to seperate topics in your website. 
You can create headings with the "h" tags. In the tag, put a number
1-9 to select a size. 1 is the largest and 9 is the smallest. Under
your heading you can use the "p" tags to write a paragraph about a topic.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>You can use HTML to create lists on your website. First you use the 
"ul" or "ol" tags. The "ul" tag is an unordered list which uses bullet 
points. The "ol" tag is an ordered list which uses numbers. Inside of 
the tags you used put "li" tags and write something in the middle of 
those tags. What you write in the "li" tags will be the items in your
list.</p>

<h2>Images and Links</h2>
<p>HTML also allows you to place images and links to other sites in your
website. To use an image use the tag "img scr= ", but write the image's 
link after "scr= ". To add a link use the "a" tag. In a tag write "a 
href= ". Like in the image tag write the link to the web site after 
"href= ".</p>
